# SwingUp the Simple Pendulum using direct Optimal Control based on the FDDP algorithm:

In this package, the single pendulum swing-up is performed using the direct optimal control based on the FDDP algorithm [(C. Mastalli, 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04947).

The script uses FDDP, BOXFddp can also be used with the same weights.
BOXFddp allows to enforce the system's torque limits.

The urdf model is modified to fit a pinocchio model.

# Theory

The costs functions for the **Running model** is written as :

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l = {\sum}_{n=1}^{T-1} \alpha_n \Phi_n(q,\dot{q},\Tau),">

With the following costs and weights, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t_S"> denoting the final time horizon.

1. _**Torque minimization**_: Minimization of the joint torques for realistic dynamic motions.

    <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Phi_{1} =  \parallel \Tau (t) \parallel ^{2}_2,  \quad \alpha_1 = 1e-4">

2. _**Posture regularization**_:  giving as input only the final reference posture.

    <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Phi_{2} = \parallel q(t)-q^{ref}(t_{s-1})\parallel ^{2}_2 ,  \quad \alpha_2 = 1e-5">



* The costs functions for the **Terminal model** are applied to only one node (the terminal node) and is written as :


    <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l_T =  \alpha_T \Phi_T(q,\dot{q}),">

With the following cost and weight, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T = t_{final}"> the final time horizon.

1. _**Posture regularization**_: giving as input only the final reference posture.


    <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Phi_{3} = \parallel q(T)-q^{ref}(T)\parallel^{2}_{2}, \quad  \alpha_{3} = 10^{10}">




The weights <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha_i"> for this optimization problem are determined experimentally.

# API

The BOXFDDP algorithm can be executed with the boxfddp_calculator class. It can be initialized with

     ddp = boxfddp_calculator(urdf_path=urdf_path,
                             enable_gui=True,
                             log_dir="log_data/ddp")

The urdf_path should point to the urdf of the pendulum in a format that pinochio accepts. The urdf for a simple pendulum can be found in the data folder of this repository: [simplependul_dfki_pino_Modi.urdf](https://github.com/dfki-ric-underactuated-lab/torque_limited_simple_pendulum/blob/master/data/urdf/simplependul_dfki_pino_Modi.urdf). enable_gui can be set to True if the trajectory shall be visualized with pinocchio after computation. In the log_dir a urdf with modified pendulum parameters will be stored.

To set the correct pendulum parameters in the urdf with:

    ddp.init_pendulum(mass=mass,
                      length=length,
                      inertia=inertia,
                      damping=damping,
                      coulomb_friction=coulomb_fric,
                      torque_limit=torque_limit)

After that the trajectory can be computed with

    T, X, U = ddp.compute_trajectory(start_state=np.array[0.0, 0.0]),
                                     goal_state=np.array[np.pi, 0.0]),
                                     dt=4e-2,
                                     T=150,
                                     running_cost_state=1e-5,
                                     running_cost_torque=1e-4,
                                     final_cost_state=1e10)

where dt is the timestep length, T is the number of timesteps. running_cost_state, running_cost_torque and final_cost_state are the individual cost weights. The method returns the time trajectory T, the state trajectory X and the control trajectory U.

# Usage

An example script for the pendulum can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/dfki-ric-underactuated-lab/torque_limited_simple_pendulum/tree/master/software/python/examples) directory. It can be started with

    python compute_BOXFDDP_swingup.py
