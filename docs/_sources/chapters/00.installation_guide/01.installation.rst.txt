Installation Guide
==================

In order to execute the python code within the repository you will need to have
`Python (>=3.6, <4)` along with the package installer `pip3` on your system
installed.

* **python (>=3.6, <4)**
* **pip3**

We recommend using a virtual environment. A guide for setting up a virtual
environment with Pyenv and virtualenv can be found in the next section.

Installing this Python Package
------------------------------
If you want to install this package, you can do
that by going to the directory `software/python
<https://github.com/dfki-ric-underactuated-lab/torque_limited_simple_pendulum/tree/master/software/python>`_
and typing::

    pip install .[all]

If you want to install a minimal version without tensorflow, stable_baselines3,
and drake you can do::

    pip install .

Note: This has to be repeated if you make changes to the library.
Note: If a package cannot be found it may help to do::

    pip install --upgrade pip
Note: This assumes that pip is pip3.

OPTIONAL: Crocoddyl and Gepetto Viewer
--------------------------------------

For installing the optimal control library Crocoddyl, we refer to the
instructions provided in the `Crocoddyl github repository
<https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl>`_ and recommend the installation through
robotpkg.

`Crocoddyl <https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl>`_ has an interface to the
gepetto-viewer for visualization. For installing the gepetto viewer we refer to
their `github repository <https://github.com/Gepetto/gepetto-viewer-corba>`_.
